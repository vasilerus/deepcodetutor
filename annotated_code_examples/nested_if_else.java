		 * program_model_question: Can you explain in detail how the goal of the current block of code is actually implemented?
		 * logical_step_details: To check whether a number is even or odd, the remainder of the number divisible by 2 is calculated using the remainder % operator. The number is even if the remainder is 0, otherwise, it is odd. If the number is even, we check if the number is less than 10. In this case, since 8 is even number less than ten program prints "8 is even number less than 10".
		 * question_1: How does the code check whether the number is even or odd?
		 * answer_1:  To check whether a number is even or odd, the remainder of the number divisible by 2 is calculated using the remainder % operator.
		 * question_2: When is the number even or odd based on the remainder operation's result?
		 * answer_2: The number is even if the remainder is 0, otherwise, it is odd.
		 * question_3: What happens if number is even in the following block of code?
		 * answer_3: If the number is even, it is checked if the number is less than 10.
		 * question_3: What is printed to the standard output when num is 12?
		 * answer_3: In this case, the program prints "12 is even number greater than 10".
